This error occurs when using a third-party library that isn't fully compatible with React Native's environment or has unmet dependencies.  It might manifest as unexpected behavior, crashes, or build failures.  Often, the error message itself is cryptic, pointing to a deeper issue within the library's code rather than your own. For example, you might encounter a vague error related to native modules or bridging issues.
