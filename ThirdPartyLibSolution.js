// Solution: Check for unmet peer dependencies, version compatibility, and potential conflicts.
// If possible, inspect the library's source code to pinpoint the exact cause of the issue.
// Consider using a different, more stable library that better integrates with React Native.
// If you have control over the library, address any incompatibilities directly in the library's code.

// Example:  Assuming the problematic library is 'react-native-uncommon-lib'

npm install react-native-uncommon-lib@latest --save //Try latest version

//Check package.json for peerDependencies of react-native-uncommon-lib and install them.

// If you can't resolve the issue, try replacing the library entirely with a more compatible alternative.
