This repository demonstrates a common yet challenging bug in React Native development: cryptic errors originating from incompatible third-party libraries. The `ThirdPartyLibBug.js` file showcases a scenario where integrating a library leads to unexpected behavior or crashes, with minimal information provided in error messages. The solution, found in `ThirdPartyLibSolution.js`, involves troubleshooting library dependencies, reviewing the library's code for potential conflicts with React Native, or exploring alternative, more compatible libraries.
